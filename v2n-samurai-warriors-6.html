Seven Samurai (Japanese: 七人の侍, Hepburn: Shichinin no Samurai) is a 1954 Japanese epic samurai drama film co-written, edited, and directed by Akira Kurosawa.The story takes place in 1586 during the Sengoku Period of Japanese history. So Isshins deathblow and death in the final battle has to be one of the most badass deaths I've ever seen. He and Sekiro clash, Sekiro gets the upper hand and slashes Isshin across the stomach, Isshin falls to his knees, yells "do it!" to Sekiro, Sekiro slashes him across the back or the neck, and Isshin falls while saying "Well done, Sekiro."

(SPOILERS) The first Warriors game I played through was Samurai Warriors 4 Empires, which I ended up enjoying much more than I expected to. But I didn't really get who any of the characters were or the context of the battles, so I decided to pick up "Spirit of Sanada," which looked the most character-focused and story-driven of the other options available on PS4. I didn't know anything about Yukimura Sanada before starting this up. But I figured he was probably the most famous samurai Hello all! I've now played through Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice two times, the first one being my blind playthrough with the Immortal Severance ending, and the second time it was a more thorough playthrough with most npc quests done and the Return ending, though i did also complete all steps towards the Alternate Immortal Severance ending as well (except the last step, of course). I feel like I want to talk about my thoughts regarding the game and since I have no friends who play it, I thought.

After scanning some other related lists, i've picked a handful of my favorite cantidates for cards so far. i have the cards listed under their respective category so you can get the jist of what the card is supposed to represent. ---------------- Spirit. Miyazaki and Fromsoftware took a very critical and subversive approach with Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Creating their own unique vision of Samurai and Ninja in their game, but one that is overall faithful to its historical counterpart. I highly hope that Sucker Punch could do the same to a similar degree all while providing their own unique voice and direction (which does seem to be the case). Cause for starters in the game. Jin is already adopting the covert guerrilla tactics of Ninjutsu Hi folks, I recently bought a ps4 and was planning to get a musou to play with my since always fan of the genre friend. I had my experiences too, with a couple Dinasty Warriors, Warriors Orochi and Sengoku Basara on PS3, but I was looking for something he could enjoy more (he's grown up with Samurai Warriors characters, so he never felt attached to the Dinasty Warriors saga). So, after a morning long reading through many posts/articles/opinions on the net I've come to these two titles:. 
Last Samurai Warriors I played was 2 on the PS2 which was one of my favorite warriors games. Both 4-II and Spirit of Sanada are on sale in Steam. so, what game should I get and which one has more content.

And as promised, I will be talking about how closely authentic is the representation of Shinobi/Ninja are in this game and how much do they parallel with their historical counterparts so without further due.

If you tell me what you play, and add me, I’ll try to play it/download it if I own it. I’m in need of multiplayer. A couple games I have installed right now with multiplayer are MVC3, Toukiden 2, Samurai Warriors 4-II, WO3U, SAO LS, All 4 of SNK’s classic fighting games, and that’s it right now. But I’m more than happy to download something to play if I had a group Heya, First time poster. I've always been interested in the Warriors games and even played some with friends, but I've never actually gotten my own. The last Dynasty Warrior game I played was the 8th one on PS Now, but I dont have the internet to stream, so I was hoping you all could assist me in my task.

A few years back a known local fraud we'll call Big Wiener (BW), from the local martial art community is a teachers assistant by day, and a vicious samurai warrior by night, in his head at least. He's gone to many legitimate schools long enough to earn a rank, yellow belt, first stripe, yellow sash, whatever. He's tried many legitimate arts, and I wouldn't take that from him, but he exaggera. 
Hey everybody! I am open to lists, but this time I'm primarily focused on my exact wants. I'll still probably look at a list, but if you don't have any of my direct wants I'm likely to pass.

The volcano was hot, almost as hot as his body that was revealed by his torn gi. It was amazing how he still managed to look so good, even in the twilight years of his life. But that life was about to end. His son, fully in a purple, naked and quite arousing, demon form, was killing him. They traded blows one after another, until Heihachi could feel Kazuy. I have just finished the Samurai Warriors 4 campaign, being every single battle possible, and I am at 98% music, I don't know what the track name is or how to get it. It is placed inbetween "Longing" and "Victory". I can't find anything on google. 
the two samurai warriors find them selves face to face against each other in hanzo's old hang out spot of hanamura, but their is a twist. they are being controlled by their mains.
